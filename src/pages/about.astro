        question: "How long does a project take?",
        answer: "Most website projects take 4-10 weeks depending on scope. I work in phases so you can see progress early and provide feedback as we go. We'll establish a timeline together before we start.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you work with my existing team?",
        answer: "Absolutely. I usually take care of the full scope myself, but I'm happy to collaborate with your team if necessary.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you help with SEO?",
        answer: "I always ensure that the websites I build are SEO-friendly. This means they have the right structure, load quickly and get Lighthouse scores of 90+ (for SEO), as well as allowing the content displayed in search results to be customised.\n\nAs part of any website project, you can upgrade to receive a detailed SEO analysis of your competitors' websites. This involves looking at over 10 years of data to find tactics and content ideas worth copying, and it includes a plan to help you implement any changes that are needed",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I need changes after launch?",
        answer: "I build sites that are easy to update and to maintain. You'll understand how everything works and be able to make changes yourself. But if you'd rather have me handle things, I offer ongoing support packages.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer concessions?",
        answer: "I understand project fees can be a lot to take in. But rest assured, the work I do is always carried out to strengthen your business and generate long-term returns. This means the result should make you money rather than cost you money, and will typically pay for itself.\n\nI'm always open to discussing options and finding a pricing structure that fits, especially for businesses with tighter budgets. And if you're struggling financially, I'm happy to chat about payment plans. The discounts I offer to everyone (these cannot be combined):\n\n• 3 easy instalments at 0% interest for all invoices over £500\n• 6 instalments at 0% interest for all invoices over £3k\n• 10% discount for paying your invoice in full before the work starts.",
    },
    {
        question: "Are meetings free?",
        answer: "If you need specific help with generating ideas or finding a solution to a problem you're having, this will be a chargeable consultation (unless this meeting was already quoted as part of your project). A consultation won't simply be an informal chat: it's a call I'll do some preparation for, so I can provide you with valuable ideas and options that will help you move forward.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I'm worried about email overload?",
        answer: "I'm flexible about how to keep in touch during a project. If you're worried about missing emails, or maybe you flinch at the very thought of following up on something that was said four emails ago, I got you. I can set up private Slack and Trello boards for real-time progress and communication at no extra cost. And if email works for you, great!",
    },
    {
        question: "Can we meet in person?",
        answer: "Why not! I'm always up for meeting clients face to face. I'm based in Folkestone, South East England, so you'll need to be able to get here. I'm happy to meet anywhere nearby when our schedules coincide.",
    },

                        I’m a designer and marketer based in Folkestone, on the
                        Kentish coast. My current focus is helping independent
                        businesses and orgs with their websites + the strategy,
                        copy, and integrations that makes them useful. Clients
                        pay less than agency prices and get one person handling

                        Before this, I spent six years in galleries,
                        universities, and an agency that represented freelance
                        film talent. Different industries but same job,
                        essentially: making complex things a little less complex
                        and helping good work find its audience. I'm a Digital
                        Arts graduate from the University of Greenwich, which is
                        where a lot of this started.

                        Well-designed things fit our needs so well that they go
                        undetected, which is why a good design is harder to spot
                        than a bad one. I'm careful not to hide behind
                        decorations, as this forces me to pursue substance over
                        trends.

                        is built, the store is opened, or the event is
                        scheduled. I get a kick out working on projects where
                        marketing can do more than just "promote", but also
                        shape the thing it's selling and find its audience.

                        code that powers the web, and sometimes that's the
                        better answer.
